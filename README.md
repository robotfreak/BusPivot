# BusPivot
An Arduino based tsukubai fountain like art installation, called the bus pivot. A modell bus is on a pivot and flooded with water by an aquarium pump. When the bus tilts, the bus door is opened by a servo and the water will run out of the bus. When the water has been spuilled out, the bus tips back and the door is closed.
